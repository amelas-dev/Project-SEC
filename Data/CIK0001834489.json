Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2019-12-31","val":218561319,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2019Q4I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":218561319,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"TemporaryEquityStockIssuedDuringPeriodValueNewIssues":{"label":"Temporary Equity, Stock Issued During Period, Value, New Issues","description":"Value of new stock classified as temporary equity issued during the period.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":6080000,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2019"}]}},"UnrecognizedTaxBenefits":{"label":"Unrecognized Tax Benefits","description":"Amount of unrecognized tax benefits.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2019-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2019Q4I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"UnsecuredDebt":{"label":"Unsecured Debt","description":"Including the current and noncurrent portions, carrying value as of the balance sheet date of uncollateralized debt obligations (with maturities initially due after one year or beyond the operating cycle if longer).","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2019-12-31","val":73061000,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2019Q4I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":82631000,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"ValueAddedTaxReceivable":{"label":"Value Added Tax Receivable","description":"Carrying amount as of the balance sheet date of value added taxes due either from customers arising from sales on credit terms, or as previously overpaid to tax authorities.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2019-12-31","val":846000,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2019Q4I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":3042000,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfShareOutstandingBasicAndDiluted":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic and Diluted","description":"Average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS).","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-09-07","val":2983170,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30"},{"start":"2018-09-08","end":"2018-12-31","val":1812601,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2018Q4"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":1829947,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":1873423,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2020"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstandingBasic":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic","description":"Number of [basic] shares or units, after adjustment for contingently issuable shares or units and other shares or units not deemed outstanding, determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares or units have been outstanding to the total time in that period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-09-07","val":2983170,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30"},{"start":"2018-09-08","end":"2018-12-31","val":1812601,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2018Q4"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":1829947,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":1873423,"accn":"0001193125-21-145204","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-30","frame":"CY2020"}]}}}}}
