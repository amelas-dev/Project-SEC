Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.2268,"accn":"0001213900-21-029395","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2020-10-01","end":"2020-10-26","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-026141","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-13","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-09-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.227,"accn":"0001213900-21-042500","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13","frame":"CY2020Q4"},{"start":"2020-09-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.2268,"accn":"0001213900-21-026141","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-13"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.23,"accn":"0001213900-21-029395","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.52,"accn":"0001213900-21-042500","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.0048,"accn":"0001213900-21-029395","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2020-10-01","end":"2020-10-26","val":0.0046,"accn":"0001213900-21-026141","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-13","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-09-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0048,"accn":"0001213900-21-042500","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13","frame":"CY2020Q4"},{"start":"2020-09-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0048,"accn":"0001213900-21-026141","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-13"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0105,"accn":"0001213900-21-029395","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0091,"accn":"0001213900-21-042500","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-03-31","val":10.83,"accn":"0001213900-21-029395","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2020Q1I"},{"end":"2020-10-26","val":9.39,"accn":"0001213900-21-026141","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-13","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.83,"accn":"0001213900-21-042500","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.83,"accn":"0001213900-21-026141","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-13"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":10.11,"accn":"0001213900-21-029395","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":18.05,"accn":"0001213900-21-042500","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"SponsorFees":{"label":"Sponsor Fees","description":"Fees paid to advisors who provide certain management support and administrative oversight services including the organization and sale of stock, investment funds, limited partnerships and mutual funds.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":1980000,"accn":"0001213900-21-042500","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
