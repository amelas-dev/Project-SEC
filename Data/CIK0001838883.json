The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.203,"accn":"0001213900-21-040141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-03"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.009,"accn":"0001213900-21-040141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-03"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.69,"accn":"0001213900-21-040141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-03","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"SharesIssued":{"label":"Shares, Issued","description":"Number of shares of stock issued as of the balance sheet date, including shares that had been issued and were previously outstanding but which are now held in the treasury.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-03-22","val":40000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-029292","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26"},{"end":"2021-03-22","val":40000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-040141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-03"},{"end":"2021-03-22","val":40000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-056713","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-04"},{"end":"2021-03-22","val":40000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-063438","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2021-12-06","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-03-22","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-029292","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26"},{"end":"2021-03-22","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-040141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-03"},{"end":"2021-03-22","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-056713","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-04"},{"end":"2021-03-22","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-063438","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2021-12-06","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
