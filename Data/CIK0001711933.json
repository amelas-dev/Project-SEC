The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.451,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.51,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.011,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.01,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodGross":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Gross","description":"Gross number of share options (or share units) granted during the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":721741,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":1343700,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value","description":"The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the reporting period as calculated by applying the disclosed option pricing methodology.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.47,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":6.96,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementsByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageExercisePrice":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangements by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"Weighted average per share amount at which grantees can acquire shares of common stock by exercise of options.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.53,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":14.25,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"SharesSubjectToMandatoryRedemptionSettlementTermsAmountNoncurrent":{"label":"Financial Instruments Subject to Mandatory Redemption, Settlement Terms, Share Value, Amount, Noncurrent","description":"The amount that is required to be paid, determined under the conditions specified in the contract, if as of the reporting date, the holder of the share has exercised the right to or the shares are mandatorily redeemable after one year from the reporting date or operating cycle, if longer.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":490000,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":490000,"accn":"0001558370-21-011258","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-11"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":490000,"accn":"0001558370-21-015099","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-09","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":2360000,"accn":"0001104659-21-069150","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-19","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
