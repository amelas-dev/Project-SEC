Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.507,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.502,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0089,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0095,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsForfeituresInPeriod":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Forfeitures in Period","description":"The number of shares under options that were cancelled during the reporting period as a result of occurrence of a terminating event specified in contractual agreements pertaining to the stock option plan.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":583753,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodGross":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Gross","description":"Gross number of share options (or share units) granted during the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":2443785,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingIntrinsicValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Intrinsic Value","description":"Amount by which the current fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of options outstanding.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":73155000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":523749000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingNumber":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Number","description":"Number of options outstanding, including both vested and non-vested options.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":15465671,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":15425660,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingWeightedAverageExercisePrice":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"Weighted average price at which grantees can acquire the shares reserved for issuance under the stock option plan.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":3.08,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":4.98,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsVestedAndExpectedToVestExercisableAggregateIntrinsicValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Vested and Expected to Vest, Exercisable, Aggregate Intrinsic Value","description":"Amount by which current fair value of underlying stock exceeds exercise price of fully vested and expected to vest exercisable or convertible options.

Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2019-12-31","val":31145475,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2019Q4I"},{"end":"2020-06-30","val":40842619,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q2I"},{"end":"2020-09-30","val":40842619,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":40842619,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":42778408,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"TemporaryEquityStockIssuedDuringPeriodValueNewIssues":{"label":"Temporary Equity, Stock Issued During Period, Value, New Issues","description":"Value of new stock classified as temporary equity issued during the period.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":91769000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":19951000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"VariableLeaseCost":{"label":"Variable Lease, Cost","description":"Amount of variable lease cost, excluded from lease liability, recognized when obligation for payment is incurred for finance and operating leases.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":543000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":162000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfDilutedSharesOutstanding":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Diluted","description":"The average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating diluted EPS or earnings per unit (EPU), determined based on the timing of issuance of shares or units in the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":23941000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":24039000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":28124000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":34680000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstandingBasic":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic","description":"Number of [basic] shares or units, after adjustment for contingently issuable shares or units and other shares or units not deemed outstanding, determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares or units have been outstanding to the total time in that period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":23941000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":24039000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":28124000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":34680000,"accn":"0001543916-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}}}}}
