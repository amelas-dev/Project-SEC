Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-15","val":0.243,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27"},{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-15","val":0.243,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.172,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.148,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-15","val":0.0106,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27"},{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-15","val":0.0106,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0098,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0107,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNonOptionEquityInstrumentsExercised":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Non-Option Equity Instruments, Exercised","description":"Number of non-option equity instruments exercised by participants.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-19","val":1300000,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-03-19","val":1300000,"accn":"0001213900-21-038740","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27"},{"end":"2021-03-19","val":1300000,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-03-15","val":9.36,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27"},{"end":"2021-03-15","val":9.36,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.55,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":9.61,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"SharesIssued":{"label":"Shares, Issued","description":"Number of shares of stock issued as of the balance sheet date, including shares that had been issued and were previously outstanding but which are now held in the treasury.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-03-15","val":12000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-038740","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27"},{"end":"2021-03-15","val":12000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27"},{"end":"2021-03-15","val":12000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-03-15","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-038740","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27"},{"end":"2021-03-15","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27"},{"end":"2021-03-15","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":11.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-038740","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":11.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-045421","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-27","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":11.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-059488","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
