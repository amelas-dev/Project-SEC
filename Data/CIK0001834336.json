Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-02-22","val":0.145,"accn":"0001213900-21-028847","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-24"},{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-02-22","val":0.145,"accn":"0001213900-21-042497","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-02-22","val":0.145,"accn":"0001213900-21-059359","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.145,"accn":"0001213900-21-028847","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-24","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-02-22","val":0.0061,"accn":"0001213900-21-028847","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-24"},{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-02-22","val":0.0061,"accn":"0001213900-21-042497","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-02-22","val":0.0061,"accn":"0001213900-21-059359","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0092,"accn":"0001213900-21-028847","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-24","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"SponsorFees":{"label":"Sponsor Fees","description":"Fees paid to advisors who provide certain management support and administrative oversight services including the organization and sale of stock, investment funds, limited partnerships and mutual funds.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-21-042497","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-21-059359","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
