Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-25","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20"},{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-25","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-029181","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26"},{"start":"2021-01-11","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-029181","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-04-13","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20"},{"start":"2021-01-11","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.3,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-25","val":0.0121,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20"},{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-25","val":0.0121,"accn":"0001213900-21-029181","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26"},{"start":"2021-01-11","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0132,"accn":"0001213900-21-029181","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-03-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0132,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-04-13","val":0.0116,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20"},{"start":"2021-01-11","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0108,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-03-25","val":9.72,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20"},{"end":"2021-03-25","val":9.72,"accn":"0001213900-21-029181","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.63,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.63,"accn":"0001213900-21-029181","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26"},{"end":"2021-04-13","val":9.68,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":10.29,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"SharesIssued":{"label":"Shares, Issued","description":"Number of shares of stock issued as of the balance sheet date, including shares that had been issued and were previously outstanding but which are now held in the treasury.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-03-31","val":13333333,"accn":"0001213900-21-029181","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":7000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-03-31","val":0.35,"accn":"0001213900-21-029181","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-26","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":0.35,"accn":"0001213900-21-044002","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-20","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0.35,"accn":"0001213900-21-060899","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
