Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-11-01","end":"2020-11-03","val":0.11,"accn":"0001213900-21-039082","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-28","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-21-039082","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-28"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-21-039612","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-30"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-21-048028","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-14"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-21-060017","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.152,"accn":"0001213900-21-039612","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-30","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.18,"accn":"0001213900-21-048028","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-14"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.109,"accn":"0001213900-21-060017","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-11-01","end":"2020-11-03","val":0.0041,"accn":"0001213900-21-039082","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-28","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0039,"accn":"0001213900-21-039082","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-28"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0039,"accn":"0001213900-21-039612","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-30"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0039,"accn":"0001213900-21-048028","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-14"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0039,"accn":"0001213900-21-060017","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0095,"accn":"0001213900-21-039612","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-30","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0081,"accn":"0001213900-21-048028","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-14"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0088,"accn":"0001213900-21-060017","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-09-30","val":10.1,"accn":"0001213900-20-041892","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-12-10","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.1,"accn":"0001213900-21-019200","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}],"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-11-03","val":9.76,"accn":"0001213900-21-039082","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-28","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.19,"accn":"0001213900-21-039082","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-28"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.19,"accn":"0001213900-21-039612","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-30"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.19,"accn":"0001213900-21-048028","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-14"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.19,"accn":"0001213900-21-060017","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.77,"accn":"0001213900-21-039612","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-30","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.87,"accn":"0001213900-21-048028","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-14","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":9.95,"accn":"0001213900-21-060017","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
