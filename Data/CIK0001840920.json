Does not include mandatorily redeemable stock. The exception is if redemption is required upon liquidation or termination of the reporting entity.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-03-31","val":0,"accn":"0001213900-21-035254","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-07-01","frame":"CY2020Q1I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":0,"accn":"0001213900-21-035254","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-07-01"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":34792358,"accn":"0001213900-21-042242","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":38500000,"accn":"0001213900-21-061254","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":34792358,"accn":"0001213900-21-042242","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":38500000,"accn":"0001213900-21-061254","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"TemporaryEquityCarryingAmountAttributableToParent":{"label":"Temporary Equity, Carrying Amount, Attributable to Parent","description":"Carrying amount, attributable to parent, of an entity's issued and outstanding stock which is not included within permanent equity.
