Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":16734179,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":25475905,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfShareOutstandingBasicAndDiluted":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic and Diluted","description":"Average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS).","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":502804,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":672911,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":997949,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":1428054,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstandingBasic":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic","description":"Number of [basic] shares or units, after adjustment for contingently issuable shares or units and other shares or units not deemed outstanding, determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares or units have been outstanding to the total time in that period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":502804,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":672911,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":997949,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":1428054,"accn":"0001558370-21-015870","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}}}}}
