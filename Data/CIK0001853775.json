Securities outstanding equals securities issued minus securities held in treasury. Temporary equity is a security with redemption features that are outside the control of the issuer, is not classified as an asset or liability in conformity with GAAP, and is not mandatorily redeemable. Includes any type of security that is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price or on a fixed or determinable date or dates, is redeemable at the option of the holder, or has conditions for redemption which are not solely within the control of the issuer. If convertible, the issuer does not control the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under the conversion option if the holder exercises the option to convert the stock to another class of equity. If the security is a warrant or a rights issue, the warrant or rights issue is considered to be temporary equity if the issuer cannot demonstrate that it would be able to deliver upon the exercise of the option by the holder in all cases. Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-06-30","val":5417193,"accn":"0001104659-21-108636","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":5417193,"accn":"0001410578-21-000353","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"UnrecognizedTaxBenefits":{"label":"Unrecognized Tax Benefits","description":"Amount of unrecognized tax benefits.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2021-03-31","val":0,"accn":"0001104659-21-088578","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":0,"accn":"0001104659-21-108636","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001410578-21-000353","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsIncomeTaxPenaltiesAndInterestAccrued":{"label":"Unrecognized Tax Benefits, Income Tax Penalties and Interest Accrued","description":"Amount accrued for interest on an underpayment of income taxes and penalties related to a tax position claimed or expected to be claimed in the tax return.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2021-03-31","val":0,"accn":"0001104659-21-088578","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":0,"accn":"0001104659-21-108636","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001410578-21-000353","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfShareOutstandingBasicAndDiluted":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic and Diluted","description":"Average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS).","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-03-02","end":"2021-03-31","val":1250000,"accn":"0001104659-21-088578","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-03-02","end":"2021-06-30","val":1363702,"accn":"0001104659-21-108636","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":1407277,"accn":"0001104659-21-108636","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-03-02","end":"2021-09-30","val":1477554,"accn":"0001410578-21-000353","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":1633891,"accn":"0001410578-21-000353","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"CashFDICInsuredAmount":{"label":"Cash, FDIC Insured Amount","description":"The amount of cash deposited in financial institutions as of the balance sheet date that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2021-09-30","val":250000,"accn":"0001410578-21-000353","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ProceedsFromIssuanceOfRedeemableConvertiblePreferredStock":{"label":"Proceeds from Issuance of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock","description":"The cash inflow from issuance of callable preferred stock which is identified as being convertible to another type of financial security at the option of the issuer or the holder.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-03-02","end":"2021-09-30","val":54171930,"accn":"0001410578-21-000353","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22"}]}},"TemporaryEquityAccretionToRedemptionValueAdjustment":{"label":"Temporary Equity, Accretion to Redemption Value, Adjustment","description":"Amount of decrease to net income for accretion of temporary equity to its redemption value to derive net income apportioned to common stockholders.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-03-02","end":"2021-09-30","val":8201970,"accn":"0001410578-21-000353","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22"}]}},"TemporaryEquitySharesIssued":{"label":"Temporary Equity, Shares Issued","description":"The number of securities classified as temporary equity that have been sold (or granted) to the entity's shareholders.
