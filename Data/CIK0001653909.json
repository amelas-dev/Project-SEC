Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2019-12-31","val":62187015,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2019Q4I"},{"end":"2020-06-30","val":62342224,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2020Q2I"},{"end":"2020-09-30","val":70990919,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":70990919,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":70990919,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":70990919,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"WarrantsAndRightsOutstanding":{"label":"Warrants and Rights Outstanding","description":"Value of outstanding derivative securities that permit the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specified price.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":5845000,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":13087000,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfDilutedSharesOutstanding":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Diluted","description":"The average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating diluted EPS or earnings per unit (EPU), determined based on the timing of issuance of shares or units in the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":53142309,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":53057406,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":54631455,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":55590320,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstandingBasic":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic","description":"Number of [basic] shares or units, after adjustment for contingently issuable shares or units and other shares or units not deemed outstanding, determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares or units have been outstanding to the total time in that period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":53142309,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":53057406,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":54631455,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":55590320,"accn":"0001653909-21-000014","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-12-07","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}}}}}
