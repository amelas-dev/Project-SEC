Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-10-01","end":"2020-10-23","val":0.131,"accn":"0001213900-21-033980","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-06-24","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.284,"accn":"0001213900-21-033980","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-06-24"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.284,"accn":"0001213900-21-035631","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.284,"accn":"0001213900-21-043108","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.284,"accn":"0001193125-21-334077","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.131,"accn":"0001213900-21-035631","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.199,"accn":"0001213900-21-043108","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-10-01","end":"2020-10-23","val":0.0041,"accn":"0001213900-21-033980","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-06-24","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0039,"accn":"0001213900-21-033980","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-06-24"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0039,"accn":"0001213900-21-035631","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0039,"accn":"0001213900-21-043108","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0039,"accn":"0001193125-21-334077","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0041,"accn":"0001213900-21-035631","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0088,"accn":"0001213900-21-043108","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-09-30","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-20-041055","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-12-04","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-019251","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}],"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-033980","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-06-24"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.41,"accn":"0001213900-21-035631","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.41,"accn":"0001213900-21-043108","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.41,"accn":"0001193125-21-334077","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.78,"accn":"0001213900-21-035631","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-02","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.88,"accn":"0001213900-21-043108","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"StateAndLocalIncomeTaxExpenseBenefitContinuingOperations":{"label":"State and Local Income Tax Expense (Benefit), Continuing Operations","description":"Amount of state and local current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) attributable to continuing operations.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":343209,"accn":"0001213900-21-033980","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-06-24"},{"start":"2020-03-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":343209,"accn":"0001213900-21-019251","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
