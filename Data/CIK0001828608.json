Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-02-09","val":0.181,"accn":"0001213900-21-028795","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-24","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.179,"accn":"0001213900-21-028795","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-24"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.18,"accn":"0001213900-21-042599","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-04-13","val":0.636,"accn":"0001213900-21-060690","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-06-01","end":"2021-06-07","val":0.646,"accn":"0001213900-21-060690","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-042599","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.661,"accn":"0001213900-21-060690","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-02-09","val":0.0072,"accn":"0001213900-21-028795","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-24","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0125,"accn":"0001213900-21-028795","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-24"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0125,"accn":"0001213900-21-042599","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-04-13","val":0.0009,"accn":"0001213900-21-060690","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-06-01","end":"2021-06-07","val":0.0007,"accn":"0001213900-21-060690","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0105,"accn":"0001213900-21-042599","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0008,"accn":"0001213900-21-060690","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-19"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
