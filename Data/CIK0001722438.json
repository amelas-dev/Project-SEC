That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.28,"accn":"0001213900-21-025423","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0045,"accn":"0001213900-21-025423","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":9.71,"accn":"0001213900-21-025423","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"SharesSubjectToMandatoryRedemptionSettlementTermsNumberOfShares":{"label":"Financial Instruments Subject to Mandatory Redemption, Settlement Terms, Number of Shares","description":"The number of shares that would be issued, determined under the conditions specified in the contract, if the settlement were to occur at the reporting date.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":32914985,"accn":"0001213900-21-012572","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-01","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"SponsorFees":{"label":"Sponsor Fees","description":"Fees paid to advisors who provide certain management support and administrative oversight services including the organization and sale of stock, investment funds, limited partnerships and mutual funds.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2019-11-25","end":"2020-12-01","val":20000,"accn":"0001213900-21-026974","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17"},{"start":"2019-11-25","end":"2020-12-01","val":20000,"accn":"0001213900-21-025423","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-11"},{"start":"2019-11-25","end":"2020-12-01","val":20000,"accn":"0001213900-21-012572","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-01"},{"start":"2020-11-25","end":"2020-12-01","val":20000,"accn":"0001213900-21-038806","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":20000,"accn":"0001213900-21-025423","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":20000,"accn":"0001213900-21-012572","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-01"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":60000,"accn":"0001213900-21-026974","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":1800,"accn":"0001213900-21-038806","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27"}]}},"StateAndLocalIncomeTaxExpenseBenefitContinuingOperations":{"label":"State and Local Income Tax Expense (Benefit), Continuing Operations","description":"Amount of state and local current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) attributable to continuing operations.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":160318,"accn":"0001213900-21-025423","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":160318,"accn":"0001213900-21-012572","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-01"}]}},"StockDividendsShares":{"label":"Stock Dividends, Shares","description":"Number of shares of common and preferred stock issued as dividends during the period.
