If convertible, the issuer does not control the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under the conversion option if the holder exercises the option to convert the stock to another class of equity. If the security is a warrant or a rights issue, the warrant or rights issue is considered to be temporary equity if the issuer cannot demonstrate that it would be able to deliver upon the exercise of the option by the holder in all cases. Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2019-12-31","val":147038267,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2019Q4I"},{"end":"2020-06-30","val":147038267,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q2I"},{"end":"2020-09-30","val":171535213,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":171535213,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":171535213,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"TemporaryEquityStockIssuedDuringPeriodValueNewIssues":{"label":"Temporary Equity, Stock Issued During Period, Value, New Issues","description":"Value of new stock classified as temporary equity issued during the period.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":117324000,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":117324000,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q3"}]}},"WarrantsAndRightsOutstanding":{"label":"Warrants and Rights Outstanding","description":"Value of outstanding derivative securities that permit the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specified price.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2021-07-22","val":143100000,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfDilutedSharesOutstanding":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Diluted","description":"The average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating diluted EPS or earnings per unit (EPU), determined based on the timing of issuance of shares or units in the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":210330946,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstandingBasic":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic","description":"Number of [basic] shares or units, after adjustment for contingently issuable shares or units and other shares or units not deemed outstanding, determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares or units have been outstanding to the total time in that period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":124,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":124,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":63121738,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":185680394,"accn":"0001818331-21-000012","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}}}}}
