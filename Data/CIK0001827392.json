Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-029785","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-28"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.169,"accn":"0001213900-21-042518","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-058803","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.137,"accn":"0001213900-21-029785","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-28","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-042518","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.142,"accn":"0001213900-21-058803","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.001,"accn":"0001213900-21-029785","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-28"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.001,"accn":"0001213900-21-042518","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.001,"accn":"0001213900-21-058803","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.001,"accn":"0001213900-21-029785","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-28","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.001,"accn":"0001213900-21-042518","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.001,"accn":"0001213900-21-058803","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-01-20","val":9.97,"accn":"0001213900-21-029785","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-28"},{"end":"2021-01-20","val":10.05,"accn":"0001213900-21-042518","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"end":"2021-01-20","val":9.97,"accn":"0001213900-21-058803","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":10.39,"accn":"0001213900-21-029785","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-28","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.97,"accn":"0001213900-21-042518","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":9.99,"accn":"0001213900-21-058803","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"SponsorFees":{"label":"Sponsor Fees","description":"Fees paid to advisors who provide certain management support and administrative oversight services including the organization and sale of stock, investment funds, limited partnerships and mutual funds.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2020-09-25","end":"2020-10-01","val":25000,"accn":"0001213900-21-029785","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-28"},{"start":"2020-09-25","end":"2020-10-01","val":25000,"accn":"0001213900-21-042518","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-13"},{"start":"2020-09-25","end":"2020-10-01","val":25000,"accn":"0001213900-21-058803","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q3I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
