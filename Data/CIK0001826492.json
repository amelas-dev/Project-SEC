Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":0.55,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.537,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.549,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2020"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMaximum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Maximum","description":"The maximum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":0.04,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.031,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.021,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2020"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMinimum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Minimum","description":"The minimum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":0.037,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.029,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.016,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2020"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodGross":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Gross","description":"Gross number of share options (or share units) granted during the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":1375500,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":941814,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":5198298,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2020"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value","description":"The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the reporting period as calculated by applying the disclosed option pricing methodology.","units":{"CNY/shares":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":1.97,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":2.65,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":3.92,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2020"}],"USD/shares":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":0.29,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.38,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.56,"accn":"0001193125-21-128979","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-04-23","frame":"CY2020"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsVestedAndExpectedToVestOutstandingAggregateIntrinsicValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Vested and Expected to Vest, Outstanding, Aggregate Intrinsic Value","description":"Amount by which current fair value of underlying stock exceeds exercise price of fully vested and expected to vest options outstanding.
