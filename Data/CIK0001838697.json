The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-18","end":"2021-02-17","val":0.253,"accn":"0001213900-21-031976","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-11","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.183,"accn":"0001213900-21-031976","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-11","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-18","end":"2021-02-17","val":0.0052,"accn":"0001213900-21-031976","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-11","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0098,"accn":"0001213900-21-031976","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-11","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-02-17","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-031976","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-11"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.63,"accn":"0001213900-21-031976","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-11","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
