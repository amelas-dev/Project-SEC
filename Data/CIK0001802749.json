Short-term investments, exclusive of cash equivalents, generally consist of marketable securities intended to be sold within one year (or the normal operating cycle if longer) and may include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, or held-to-maturity securities (if maturing within one year), as applicable.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-06-30","val":202000000,"accn":"0001564590-20-040160","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-08-14","frame":"CY2020Q2I"},{"end":"2020-09-30","val":202000000,"accn":"0001564590-21-028372","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-09-30","val":202000000,"accn":"0001564590-20-053714","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-11-13"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":202000000,"accn":"0001564590-21-017109","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"CashCashEquivalentsRestrictedCashAndRestrictedCashEquivalents":{"label":"Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents","description":"Amount of cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalents restricted to withdrawal or usage.

Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.68,"accn":"0001558370-21-011823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.54,"accn":"0001558370-21-016003","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0082,"accn":"0001558370-21-011823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0068,"accn":"0001558370-21-016003","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodGross":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Gross","description":"Gross number of share options (or share units) granted during the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":395127,"accn":"0001558370-21-011823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0,"accn":"0001558370-21-011823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":842194,"accn":"0001558370-21-016003","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":447067,"accn":"0001558370-21-016003","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"StockAndWarrantsIssuedDuringPeriodValuePreferredStockAndWarrants":{"label":"Stock and Warrants Issued During Period, Value, Preferred Stock and Warrants","description":"Value of preferred stock and warrants for common stock issued.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":646000,"accn":"0001558370-21-011823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":646000,"accn":"0001558370-21-011823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":646000,"accn":"0001558370-21-016003","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
