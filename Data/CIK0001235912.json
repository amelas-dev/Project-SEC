If convertible, the issuer does not control the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under the conversion option if the holder exercises the option to convert the stock to another class of equity. If the security is a warrant or a rights issue, the warrant or rights issue is considered to be temporary equity if the issuer cannot demonstrate that it would be able to deliver upon the exercise of the option by the holder in all cases. Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":223541754,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":223541754,"accn":"0001558370-21-014953","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-08","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":223541754,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001558370-21-014953","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-08","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfShareOutstandingBasicAndDiluted":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic and Diluted","description":"Average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS).","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":414225,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"start":"2020-04-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":360238,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09","frame":"CY2020Q2"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":396071,"accn":"0001558370-21-014953","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-08"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":360356,"accn":"0001558370-21-014953","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-08","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":363397,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":366066,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":6975386,"accn":"0001558370-21-014953","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-08"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":20126672,"accn":"0001558370-21-014953","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-08","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstandingBasic":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic","description":"Number of [basic] shares or units, after adjustment for contingently issuable shares or units and other shares or units not deemed outstanding, determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares or units have been outstanding to the total time in that period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":414225,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"start":"2020-04-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":360238,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09","frame":"CY2020Q2"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":363397,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":366066,"accn":"0001558370-21-010996","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09","frame":"CY2021Q2"}]}},"AdjustmentsToAdditionalPaidInCapitalStockIssuedIssuanceCosts":{"label":"Adjustments to Additional Paid in Capital, Stock Issued, Issuance Costs","description":"Amount of decrease in additional paid in capital (APIC) resulting from direct costs associated with issuing stock.
