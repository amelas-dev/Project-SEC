Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-12-01","end":"2020-12-15","val":0.113,"accn":"0001213900-21-036943","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-15","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2020-08-27","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.13,"accn":"0001213900-21-036943","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-15"},{"start":"2020-08-27","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.13,"accn":"0001213900-21-042943","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2020-08-27","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.13,"accn":"0001213900-21-058274","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.122,"accn":"0001213900-21-037141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-16","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.135,"accn":"0001213900-21-042943","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.118,"accn":"0001213900-21-058274","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-12-01","end":"2020-12-15","val":0.0059,"accn":"0001213900-21-036943","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-15","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2020-08-27","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0057,"accn":"0001213900-21-036943","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-15"},{"start":"2020-08-27","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0057,"accn":"0001213900-21-042943","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2020-08-27","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0057,"accn":"0001213900-21-058274","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0121,"accn":"0001213900-21-037141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-16","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0103,"accn":"0001213900-21-042943","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0109,"accn":"0001213900-21-058274","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":1,"accn":"0001213900-21-019320","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}],"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":1,"accn":"0001213900-21-036943","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-15","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":1,"accn":"0001213900-21-037141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-16","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":1,"accn":"0001213900-21-042943","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":1,"accn":"0001213900-21-058274","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"SponsorFees":{"label":"Sponsor Fees","description":"Fees paid to advisors who provide certain management support and administrative oversight services including the organization and sale of stock, investment funds, limited partnerships and mutual funds.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2020-08-27","end":"2020-12-31","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-21-019320","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31"},{"start":"2020-08-27","end":"2020-12-31","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-21-036943","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-15","frame":"CY2020Q4"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-21-037141","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-16","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-21-042943","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-21-058274","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
