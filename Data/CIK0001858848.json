If convertible, the issuer does not control the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under the conversion option if the holder exercises the option to convert the stock to another class of equity. If the security is a warrant or a rights issue, the warrant or rights issue is considered to be temporary equity if the issuer cannot demonstrate that it would be able to deliver upon the exercise of the option by the holder in all cases. Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":24493528,"accn":"0001564590-21-047363","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-08"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":24493528,"accn":"0001564590-21-056238","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":26102278,"accn":"0001564590-21-047363","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-08","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"VariableLeaseCost":{"label":"Variable Lease, Cost","description":"Amount of variable lease cost, excluded from lease liability, recognized when obligation for payment is incurred for finance and operating leases.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":800000,"accn":"0001564590-21-047363","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-08"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":400000,"accn":"0001564590-21-047363","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-08","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":1200000,"accn":"0001564590-21-056238","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":400000,"accn":"0001564590-21-056238","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfShareOutstandingBasicAndDiluted":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic and Diluted","description":"Average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS).","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":920196,"accn":"0001564590-21-047363","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-08"},{"start":"2020-04-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":948403,"accn":"0001564590-21-047363","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-08","frame":"CY2020Q2"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":947009,"accn":"0001564590-21-056238","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":1000052,"accn":"0001564590-21-056238","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":1122775,"accn":"0001564590-21-047363","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-08"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":1147471,"accn":"0001564590-21-047363","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-08","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":9808162,"accn":"0001564590-21-056238","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":26895716,"accn":"0001564590-21-056238","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"AccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncomeLossNetOfTax":{"label":"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax","description":"Accumulated change in equity from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, net of tax effect, at period end.

For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents.
