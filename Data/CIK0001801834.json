The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.7229,"accn":"0001178913-21-001089","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-03-18","frame":"CY2019"},{"start":"2019-07-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.7229,"accn":"0001213900-20-029246","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"6-K","filed":"2020-09-30"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":0.75,"accn":"0001213900-20-029246","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"6-K","filed":"2020-09-30"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":0.0029,"accn":"0001213900-20-029246","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"6-K","filed":"2020-09-30"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":0.747,"accn":"0001178913-21-001089","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-03-18","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
