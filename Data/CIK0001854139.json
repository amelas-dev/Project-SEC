Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.475,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.009,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisableNumber":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Exercisable, Number","description":"The number of shares into which fully or partially vested stock options outstanding as of the balance sheet date can be currently converted under the option plan.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-09-30","val":851465,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsForfeituresAndExpirationsInPeriod":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Forfeitures and Expirations in Period","description":"For presentations that combine terminations, the number of shares under options that were cancelled during the reporting period as a result of occurrence of a terminating event specified in contractual agreements pertaining to the stock option plan or that expired.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":1438,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsForfeituresAndExpirationsInPeriodWeightedAverageExercisePrice":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Forfeitures and Expirations in Period, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"Weighted average price of options that were either forfeited or expired.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.01,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingNumber":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Number","description":"Number of options outstanding, including both vested and non-vested options.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":1404516,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":1433264,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingWeightedAverageExercisePrice":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"Weighted average price at which grantees can acquire the shares reserved for issuance under the stock option plan.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":0.49,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":2.28,"accn":"0000950170-21-004366","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-12","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsVestedAndExpectedToVestExercisableAggregateIntrinsicValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Vested and Expected to Vest, Exercisable, Aggregate Intrinsic Value","description":"Amount by which current fair value of underlying stock exceeds exercise price of fully vested and expected to vest exercisable or convertible options.
