Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-13","end":"2021-01-14","val":0.242,"accn":"0001493152-21-012524","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-21"},{"start":"2021-01-13","end":"2021-01-14","val":0.242,"accn":"0001493152-21-019063","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"start":"2021-01-13","end":"2021-01-14","val":0.242,"accn":"0001493152-21-029551","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.143,"accn":"0001493152-21-012524","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-21","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.198,"accn":"0001493152-21-019063","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.187,"accn":"0001493152-21-029551","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-13","end":"2021-01-14","val":0.006,"accn":"0001493152-21-012524","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-21"},{"start":"2021-01-13","end":"2021-01-14","val":0.006,"accn":"0001493152-21-019063","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"start":"2021-01-13","end":"2021-01-14","val":0.006,"accn":"0001493152-21-029551","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0103,"accn":"0001493152-21-012524","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-21","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.009,"accn":"0001493152-21-019063","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.01,"accn":"0001493152-21-029551","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-01-14","val":9.41,"accn":"0001493152-21-012524","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-21"},{"end":"2021-01-14","val":9.41,"accn":"0001493152-21-019063","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09"},{"end":"2021-01-14","val":9.41,"accn":"0001493152-21-029551","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.82,"accn":"0001493152-21-012524","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-21","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.96,"accn":"0001493152-21-019063","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-09","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":10.08,"accn":"0001493152-21-029551","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-22","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-11-20","val":0.012,"accn":"0001493152-21-007884","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-04-02","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
