Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.143,"accn":"0001213900-21-044342","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.143,"accn":"0001213900-21-038923","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.111,"accn":"0001213900-21-038923","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.143,"accn":"0001213900-21-044342","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.0067,"accn":"0001213900-21-044342","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-01-20","val":0.0067,"accn":"0001213900-21-038923","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.012,"accn":"0001213900-21-038923","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0103,"accn":"0001213900-21-044342","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-01-20","val":9.59,"accn":"0001213900-21-044342","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-01-20","val":9.59,"accn":"0001213900-21-038923","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.66,"accn":"0001213900-21-038923","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.69,"accn":"0001213900-21-044342","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-01-20","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-044342","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-23","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-01-20","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-038923","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-27"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
