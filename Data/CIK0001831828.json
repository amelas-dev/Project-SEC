Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":182772372,"accn":"0001193125-21-198663","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-24"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":182772372,"accn":"0001193125-21-247714","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":182772372,"accn":"0000950170-21-004117","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":182772372,"accn":"0001193125-21-198663","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-24","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":0,"accn":"0001193125-21-247714","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0000950170-21-004117","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfShareOutstandingBasicAndDiluted":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Basic and Diluted","description":"Average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS).","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":317693,"accn":"0001193125-21-198663","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-24","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":321207,"accn":"0001193125-21-247714","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2020-04-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":324720,"accn":"0001193125-21-247714","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2020Q2"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":322811,"accn":"0000950170-21-004117","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":325985,"accn":"0000950170-21-004117","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":385401,"accn":"0001193125-21-198663","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-24","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":5470609,"accn":"0001193125-21-247714","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":10499937,"accn":"0001193125-21-247714","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":10793436,"accn":"0000950170-21-004117","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":21265519,"accn":"0000950170-21-004117","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"RestructuringCosts":{"label":"Restructuring Costs","description":"Amount, after cash payment, of expenses associated with exit or disposal activities pursuant to an authorized plan.
