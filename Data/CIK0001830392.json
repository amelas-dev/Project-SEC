Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-11-16","end":"2021-01-15","val":0.23,"accn":"0001213900-21-036327","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-09","frame":"CY2020Q4"},{"start":"2020-12-25","end":"2021-01-15","val":0.23,"accn":"0001213900-21-040294","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-04","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.138,"accn":"0001213900-21-040294","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-04","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.138,"accn":"0001213900-21-036327","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-09"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.16,"accn":"0001213900-21-040294","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-04"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-11-16","end":"2021-01-15","val":0.0012,"accn":"0001213900-21-036327","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-09","frame":"CY2020Q4"},{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0006,"accn":"0001213900-21-036327","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-09","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMaximum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Maximum","description":"The maximum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-11-16","end":"2021-01-15","val":0.0063,"accn":"0001213900-21-036327","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-09","frame":"CY2020Q4"},{"start":"2020-12-25","end":"2021-01-15","val":0.0063,"accn":"0001213900-21-040294","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-04","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.011,"accn":"0001213900-21-040294","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-04","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-02-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.011,"accn":"0001213900-21-036327","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-09"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0095,"accn":"0001213900-21-040294","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-04"}]}},"ShortTermBorrowings":{"label":"Short-term Debt","description":"Reflects the total carrying amount as of the balance sheet date of debt having initial terms less than one year or the normal operating cycle, if longer.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":300000,"accn":"0001213900-21-018907","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":300000,"accn":"0001213900-21-036327","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-09","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":300000,"accn":"0001213900-21-040294","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-04","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":300000,"accn":"0001213900-21-056985","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-05","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
