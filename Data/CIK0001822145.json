Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-30","val":0.1875,"accn":"0001213900-21-063424","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-12-03"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.1915,"accn":"0001213900-21-033606","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-22"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.1915,"accn":"0001213900-21-041959","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-12"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.1915,"accn":"0001213900-21-059349","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.1915,"accn":"0001213900-21-063424","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-12-03"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.1915,"accn":"0001213900-21-063430","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2021-12-06","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.125,"accn":"0001213900-21-033606","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-22","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.09,"accn":"0001213900-21-041959","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-12"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.065,"accn":"0001213900-21-059349","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.065,"accn":"0001213900-21-063430","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2021-12-06"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-30","val":0.0038,"accn":"0001213900-21-063424","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-12-03"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0036,"accn":"0001213900-21-033606","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-22"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0036,"accn":"0001213900-21-041959","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-12"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0036,"accn":"0001213900-21-059349","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0036,"accn":"0001213900-21-063424","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-12-03"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0036,"accn":"0001213900-21-063430","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2021-12-06","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0092,"accn":"0001213900-21-033606","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-22","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.00872,"accn":"0001213900-21-041959","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-12"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0098,"accn":"0001213900-21-059349","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0098,"accn":"0001213900-21-063430","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2021-12-06"}]}},"SharebasedCompensationSharesAuthorizedUnderStockOptionPlansExercisePriceRangeExercisableOptionsWeightedAverageExercisePrice1":{"label":"Share-based Payment Arrangement, Option, Exercise Price Range, Exercisable, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"Weighted average exercise price as of the balance sheet date for those equity-based payment arrangements exercisable and outstanding.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":11.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-041959","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-12","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":11.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-033606","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-22"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":11.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-033606","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-22","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":11.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-041959","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-12","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
