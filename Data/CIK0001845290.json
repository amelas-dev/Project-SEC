However, a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"CommitmentsAndContingencies":{"label":"Commitments and Contingencies","description":"Represents the caption on the face of the balance sheet to indicate that the entity has entered into (1) purchase or supply arrangements that will require expending a portion of its resources to meet the terms thereof, and (2) is exposed to potential losses or, less frequently, gains, arising from (a) possible claims against a company's resources due to future performance under contract terms, and (b) possible losses or likely gains from uncertainties that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events that are deemed likely to occur do occur or fail to occur.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"CommonStockDividendsPerShareDeclared":{"label":"Common Stock, Dividends, Per Share, Declared","description":"Aggregate dividends declared during the period for each share of common stock outstanding.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02"},{"start":"2020-07-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2020Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":37.386817,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":37.386817,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2021Q3"}]}},"CommonUnitAuthorized":{"label":"Common Unit, Authorized","description":"Maximum number of common units of ownership permitted to be issued by a limited liability company (LLC).","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":500000000,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":500000000,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"CommonUnitIssuanceValue":{"label":"Common Unit, Issuance Value","description":"Stated value of common units of ownership issued by a limited liability company (LLC).","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":178062000,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":192207000,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"CommonUnitIssued":{"label":"Common Unit, Issued","description":"Number of common units issued of limited liability company (LLC).","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":87361929,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":88197409,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"CommonUnitOutstanding":{"label":"Common Unit, Outstanding","description":"Number of common units of ownership outstanding of a limited liability company (LLC).","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":87361929,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":88197409,"accn":"0001628280-21-021079","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-02","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax":{"label":"Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax, Attributable to Parent","description":"Amount after tax of increase (decrease) in equity from transactions and other events and circumstances from net income and other comprehensive income, attributable to parent entity.
