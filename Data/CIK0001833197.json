The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-07-03","val":0.3816,"accn":"0001104659-21-100799","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-05"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-10-02","val":0.3816,"accn":"0001558370-21-015513","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-07-03","val":0.0063,"accn":"0001104659-21-100799","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-05"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-10-02","val":0.0063,"accn":"0001558370-21-015513","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Number of Shares Authorized","description":"Number of shares authorized for issuance under share-based payment arrangement.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-04-12","val":13170212,"accn":"0001104659-21-100799","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-05"},{"end":"2021-04-12","val":13170212,"accn":"0001558370-21-015513","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardPlanModificationIncrementalCompensationCost":{"label":"Share-based Payment Arrangement, Plan Modification, Incremental Cost","description":"An excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the award immediately before the modification.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-07-31","val":49000000,"accn":"0001104659-21-100799","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-05","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-10-02","val":49000000,"accn":"0001558370-21-015513","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"}]}},"SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardOptionsVestedWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Vested, Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value","description":"Weighted average grant-date fair value of options vested.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-07-03","val":7.2,"accn":"0001104659-21-100799","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-05"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-10-02","val":7.2,"accn":"0001558370-21-015513","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-10"}]}},"StandardProductWarrantyAccrual":{"label":"Standard Product Warranty Accrual","description":"Amount as of the balance sheet date of the aggregate standard product warranty liability.
