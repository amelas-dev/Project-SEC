The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.5995,"accn":"0001564590-21-028052","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-14","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":0.6,"accn":"0000950170-21-001499","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0.6196,"accn":"0000950170-21-004630","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.667,"accn":"0001564590-21-028052","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-14","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.7056,"accn":"0000950170-21-001499","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.7659,"accn":"0000950170-21-004630","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.0058,"accn":"0001564590-21-028052","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-14","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":0.0057,"accn":"0000950170-21-001499","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0.0043,"accn":"0000950170-21-004630","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0076,"accn":"0001564590-21-028052","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-14","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0088,"accn":"0000950170-21-001499","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0112,"accn":"0000950170-21-004630","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
