Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-26","end":"2021-02-25","val":0.25,"accn":"0001213900-21-031463","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-08","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.25,"accn":"0001213900-21-031463","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-08","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-26","end":"2021-02-25","val":0.009,"accn":"0001213900-21-031463","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-08","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.01,"accn":"0001213900-21-031463","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-08","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
